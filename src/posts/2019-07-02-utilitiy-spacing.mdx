## The problem
When a designer is working on a UI in something like Sketch they will get the spacing to look how they want, normally based on a pre-defined spacing scale.

<SideScroller>
    <Spacer size={16}/>
    <Spacer size={20}/>
    <Spacer size={24}/>
    <Spacer size={48}/>
    <Spacer size={56}/>
    <Spacer size={72}/>
    <Spacer size={96}/>
    <Spacer size={128}/>
</SideScroller>

## Fist solution - Spacing SASS variables and a class for each

## Second solution - Responsive classes

## Third solution - Fully responsive set of utilities

### File size worries

#### Calculator
<Calculator/>

### Purge css
